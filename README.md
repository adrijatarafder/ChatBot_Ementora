ChatBot — Ementora (Torabot)


This project is a simple chatbot created as part of the Ementora platform. The main idea behind this chatbot is to provide an interactive way for users to communicate with a system through a conversational interface instead of traditional forms or menus.
The chatbot runs on a web interface and uses JavaScript and Node.js to handle communication between the user and the server.
It is designed to be beginner-friendly and easy to expand in the future with AI features.

Provides a chatbot interface on a website
Takes user input and generates responses
Connects frontend and backend using Node.js
Demonstrates how chat systems work in real applications


Technologies Used:-
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Node.js
Express.js (for server handling)
